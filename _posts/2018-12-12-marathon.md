title: "Race Report C-Ville half"
---
I completed my first half-marathon at the C-Ville marathon/half-marathon finishing 81st out of 544 runners @1:51:37 

I also finished the [Vermonster](https://www.benjerry.com/whats-new/2014/vermonster-sundaes) at Ben and Jerrys. Regardless of what anyone else says, I finished it.
