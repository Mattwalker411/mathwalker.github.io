title: "New preprint available on Mpmeba, Dynamics, and Maxwell's Demon"
---
# New Preprint with Saikat Aug. 2023

Marija, her other graduate student, and I finished a second project on how the Mpemba effect arises in a linear reaction network and how this shortcut in time to relax can improve the performance of a Maxwell demon and information engine.
