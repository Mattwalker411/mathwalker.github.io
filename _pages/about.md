I am a graduate student at the University of Virginia. I earned my Bachelors from the University of Virginia in 2018, and took a gap year before coming back for a Ph.D. Outside of physics I enjoy riding my bike, practicing the drums, and reading. During my time as an undergrad, I helped build the website alongside [Steven Stetzler](https://stevenstetzler.com/) for the [Society of Physics Students](https://spsatuva.github.io/).
I sometimes write blog posts about books that I am reading, or when I compete in race. Follow me on [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/97757643-matt-walker) and [Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/56851114).
