I recently graduated from the University of Virginia in May 2018, with a B.S in physics. I am now a graduate student at UVA working towards a Ph.D. Outside of physics I enjoy studying abstract algebra and topology, and I am fascinated by their applications in physics. During my time at UVA, I was an executive board member of both the Math Club and the Society of Physics Students. In particular, I helped build the website alongside [Steven Stetzler](https://stevenstetzler.com/) for the [Society of Physics Students](https://spsatuva.github.io/) and I encourage students to take advantage of the resources I made available. I am an avid triathlete and spend a considerable amount of time at the gym running, cycling, swimming, and competing in races several times a year. I have also spent the last four years practicing the drum set, and I enjoy making music.
