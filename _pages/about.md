I am a graduate student at the University of Virginia. I earned my Bachelors from the University of Virginia in 2018, and took a gap year before coming back for a Ph.D. Outside of physics I enjoy riding my bike, practicing the drums, and reading. During my time as an undergrad, I helped build the website alongside [Steven Stetzler](https://stevenstetzler.com/) for the [Society of Physics Students](https://spsatuva.github.io/)
