I recently graduated from the University of Virginia in May 2018, with a B.S in physics. I am now taking a gap year between undergrad and grad school to prepare for the physics GRE and continue research. My research interests are in Condensed Matter Theory, specifically topological phases and non equilibrium dynamics. I have spent the last year working with an undergraduate research group at UVA studying bi-layer graphene under professor Teo. Recently I have began working for another Condensed Matter theorist studying non-equilibrium dynamics and statistical physics (see below). Outside of physics I really enjoy studying group theory and topology and am fascinated by their applications in physics. During my time at UVA I was exec board member of both the Math club and the Society of Physics Students. In particular I built the website for the Society of Physics Students and I encourage students to take advantage of the resources I made available. I am an avid triathlete and spend a considerable amount of time at the gym running, cycling, swimming, and competing in races several times a year. I have also spent the last four years practicing the drum set and I enjoy making music.
