I am a graduate student at the University of Virginia. I earned my Bachelors from the University of Virginia in 2018, and took a gap year before coming back for a Ph.D. Outside of physics I enjoy riding my bike, practicing the drums, and reading. During my time as an undergrad, I helped build the website alongside [Steven Stetzler](https://stevenstetzler.com/) for the [Society of Physics Students](https://spsatuva.github.io/).
I sometimes post blog posts about books that I am reading, or when I compete in race. Follow me on [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/97757643-matt-walker) and [Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/56851114). 


I am a big fan of YouTuber [Ali Abdaal](https://www.youtube.com/user/Sepharoth64), and he tweeted a brief clip commenting that one of his biggest regrets in life was not starting a blog where he could post notes on the books he was reading. I figured since I already have a website I would start doing this myself, especially since I read exclusievly nonfiction, and I often am reading a book because I hope to learn something. I will post my "notes" on my webpage from time to time and maybe someone will find them useful. At the very least I will look back at them myself.
