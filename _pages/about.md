I am a physicist and current research staff member at the [Institute for Defense Analyses (IDA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute_for_Defense_Analyses). I earned both my bachelorâ€™s and PhD from the University of Virginia. My PhD work was on the [Mpemba Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mpemba_effect). During summer of 2024 I was an ORISE scholar through the DoD High Performance Computing Modernization Program (HPCMP), where I worked on computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Outside of physics I enjoy riding my bike, practicing the drums, and reading. During my time as an undergrad, I helped build the website alongside [Steven Stetzler](https://stevenstetzler.com/) for the [Society of Physics Students](https://spsatuva.github.io/).
